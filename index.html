    <h1>Bubble Sort Algorithm Visualizer</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through
        the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps
        them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is
        repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is
        sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller or larger
        elements "bubble" to the top of the list as the sort progresses. It is a
        very inefficient algorithm and it's generally not used in practice, but
        it's useful for understanding the basics of sorting algorithms.
