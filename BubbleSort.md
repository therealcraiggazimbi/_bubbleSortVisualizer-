# Bubble Sort Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a bubble sort algorithm visualizer, which displays an interactive visual representation of the bubble sort algorithm. It generates random data and sorts it using the bubble sort algorithm while playing audio tones for each comparison and swap.

## How it works

1. The visualizer generates an array of 30 random numbers.
1. When the "Play" button is clicked, the visualizer starts sorting the array using the bubble sort algorithm.
1. During the sorting process, the visualizer animates the comparison and swap of elements in the array, and plays audio tones corresponding to the elements being compared or swapped.
1. The visualizer uses a custom implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, which keeps track of the comparison and swap operations for the animation.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript to run the visualizer.

# Usage

1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
1. The visualizer will generate an array of random numbers and display it as a series of vertical bars.
1. Click the "Play" button to start the bubble sort algorithm visualization.
1. Watch the animation as the bubble sort algorithm compares and swaps elements in the array.
1. After the algorithm is finished, the sorted array will be displayed.

## Customization

You can customize the visualizer by modifying the following variables:

- \_n: The number of elements in the array (default is 30).
- \_duration: The duration of the audio tones played during the visualization (default is 0.1 seconds).

# Limitations

The visualizer does not support resizing the window or changing the number of elements in the array during the visualization process.

The audio tones may not play correctly on all devices and browsers.
